# CW rework of [QB-Racing](https://github.com/ItsANoBrainer/qb-racing)

This is a rework of the superb free resource [QB-Racing](https://github.com/ItsANoBrainer/qb-racing) by ItsANoBrainer.


**Some of the added features:**
- Integration with [cw-performance](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-performance) to create class based racing
- Advanced leaderboard for each track and class showing everyones best times
- By-class leaderboard
- Replacement of tire-piles lamps
- Increased size of checkpoints
- Not as harsh checkpoint-pass detection compared to qb-racing
- Remove race tracks you have created
- See your position in the race
- Updated HUD
- Accurate time (old one would vary depending on computer performance) **NOW IN MS!**
- Ability to reset/run the SQL scripts from in game
- Phasing/Ghosting of racers
- Ability to lock tracks down to people by citizen ID
- Support for Renewed Crypto
- Participation payouts
- Post race leaderboard
- Custom UI
- Track curation

**Original features by ItsANoBrainer:**
- Standalone racing script not requiring qb-phone to utilize
- Items to immerse your racing scene with Racer Names
- Config options to adjust item permissions to your liking
- Config options to adjust different options
- Locale Support
- Create Custom Races Tracks

> As of update posted on 1st July -23, racer names are unique. The max limit is by default 3 but can be set individually. If you want to remove names from DB without openign it up, an admin can use `/remracename <racerName>`

> As of update posted on 26th August -23 we will no longer support qb-menu usage.

# Racing App

This script lets you manage your racing scene in a better way using items and custom racer names instead of player names! There are two items involved, the `master racing fob`, and the `basic racing fob`. At the moment, these are created using the `createracingfob` command by a qb-core admin, but you can implement any system you want. When created, the fob is bound to the citizenid it was created for, and has a racer name attached to it. Only the citizenid created for it can use it. Using the fob brings up the racing options menu (examples below) which is where you do all the interacting with the script. Each fob has an entry in the Config to tune it to your server to allow or deny certain usage abilities (listed below). By default the master racing fob is required to CREATE new race tracks, and both dongles allow you to do everything else.

Options:
 - Join a race
 - View race records
 - Setup a new race
 - Create a new race track
 - Modify old tracks
 - List your own tracks
 - Open a slimmed down version of [cw-mechtool](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-mechtool) (disable in config if you dont have this)
 
 ### Track Curation
 Our idea with this feature is to allow admins to flag a track as "DONE". The track can no longer be edited. Additional features of curated tracks might be only allowing participation money to be paid out on those tracks, for example.

 Currently you can only curate/uncurate a track via admin command: `/racingappcurated "<race-id>" true/false` **QUOTATION MARKS AROUND RACE ID IS IMPORTANT**

## Setup
You only need either this resource and [cw-performance](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-performance).

1. Update or insert the database tables. These are found in the `racing.sql` file
2. Adjust values in the `config.lua` file to your liking
3. Add the items to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua`
```lua
['fob_racing_basic'] = {['name'] = 'fob_racing_basic', ['label'] = 'Basic Racing GPS', ['weight'] = 500, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'fob_racing_basic.png', ['unique'] = true, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['description'] = 'This basic GPS allows someone to join custom races.'},
['fob_racing_master'] = {['name'] = 'fob_racing_master', ['label'] = 'Master Racing GPS', ['weight'] = 500, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'fob_racing_master.png', ['unique'] = true, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['description'] = 'This master GPS allows someone to create custom races.'},
```
4. Add the item images to your inventory image folder

> NOTE: You **CAN NOT** spawn the racing fobs with `/giveitem`. Spawn them with the built in command `/createracingfob` or get one at the trader or laptop
